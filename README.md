# Drowsiness-Detection-System

## Introduction
The Drowsiness Detection System is an innovative IoT-based project designed to enhance road safety by detecting and alerting drowsy drivers. This project utilizes Python, OpenCV, and Arduino to analyze real-time video data and identify signs of driver fatigue.

## Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to reduce road accidents caused by driver drowsiness. By employing advanced facial landmark detection algorithms, the system actively monitors the driver and triggers alerts to prevent potential accidents.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the core logic and processing video data.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and facial landmark detection.
- **Arduino**: To interface with the hardware and trigger real-world alerts.
- **Dlib**: For accurate facial feature detection.

## Features
- Real-time drowsiness detection using live video feed.
- Facial landmark analysis to detect eye blink patterns.
- Alert system using Arduino to warn the driver when drowsiness is detected.

## Setup and Installation
Detailed steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Python Environment Setup**: Ensure Python is installed and set up properly on your system.
2. **OpenCV and Dlib Installation**: Install OpenCV and Dlib libraries using pip.
3. **Arduino Configuration**: Set up the Arduino environment and upload the provided code to the Arduino board.
4. **Running the Application**: Execute the Python script to start the drowsiness detection.

## Code Explanation
Brief explanation of the main components of the code:

- **Python Script**: The script processes the video feed and utilizes OpenCV and Dlib to detect facial landmarks. Eye blink patterns are analyzed to detect drowsiness.
- **Arduino Code**: Responsible for triggering alerts based on the signal received from the Python script.

## Future Enhancements
Ideas for further improving the system:

- Integration with vehicle control systems for automated responses.
- Machine learning implementation for more accurate drowsiness prediction.
- Mobile app integration for broader accessibility.
